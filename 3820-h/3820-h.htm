<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Gotthold Ephraim Lessing</span> was born
on the 22nd of January, 1729, eldest of ten sons of a pious and
learned minister of Camenz in the Oberlausitz, who had two
daughters also.&nbsp; As a child Lessing delighted in books, and
had knowledge beyond his years when he went to school, in
Meissen, at the age of twelve.&nbsp; As a school-boy he read much
Greek and Latin that formed no part of the school course; read
also the German poets of his time, wrote a &ldquo;History of
Ancient Mathematics,&rdquo; and began a poem of his own on the
&ldquo;Plurality of Worlds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1746, at the age of seventeen, Lessing was sent to the
University of Leipsic.&nbsp; There he studied with energy, and
was attracted strongly by the theatre.&nbsp; His artistic
interest in the drama caused him to be put on the free list of
the theatre, in exchange for some translations of French
pieces.&nbsp; Then he produced, also for the Leipsic stage, many
slight pieces of his own, and he had serious thought of turning
actor, which excited alarm in the parsonage at Camenz and caused
his recall home in January, 1747.&nbsp; It was found, however,
that although he could not be trained to follow his
father&rsquo;s profession, he had been studying to such good
purpose, and developing, in purity of life, such worth of
character, that after Easter he was sent back to Leipsic, with
leave to transfer his studies from theology to medicine.</p>
<p>Lessing went back, continued to work hard, but still also gave
all his leisure to the players.&nbsp; For the debts of some of
them he had incautiously become surety, and when the company
removed to Vienna, there were left behind them unpaid debts for
which young Lessing was answerable.&nbsp; The creditors pressed,
and Lessing moved to Wittenberg; but he fell ill, and was made so
miserable by pressure for impossible payments, that he resolved
to break off his studies, go to Berlin, and begin earning by his
pen, his first earnings being for the satisfaction of these
Leipsic creditors.&nbsp; Lessing went first to Berlin to seek his
fortune in December, 1748, when he was nineteen years old.&nbsp;
He was without money, without decent clothes, and with but one
friend in Berlin, Mylius, who was then editing a small journal,
the <i>Rudigersche Zeitung</i>.&nbsp; Much correspondence brought
him a little money from the overburdened home, and with addition
of some small earning from translations, this enabled him to
obtain a suit of clothes, in which he might venture to present
himself to strangers in his search for fortune.&nbsp; A new
venture with Mylius, a quarterly record of the history of the
theatre, was not successful; but having charge committed to him
of the library part of Mylius&rsquo;s journal, Lessing had an
opportunity of showing his great critical power.&nbsp; Gottsched,
at Leipsic, was then leader of the war on behalf of classicism in
German literature.&nbsp; Lessing fought on the National side, and
opposed also the beginning of a new French influence then rising,
which was to have its chief apostle in Rousseau.</p>
<p>In 1752 Lessing went back to Wittenberg for another year, that
he might complete the work for graduation; graduated in December
of that year as Master of Arts, and then returned to his work in
Berlin.&nbsp; He worked industriously, not only as critic, but
also in translation from the classics, from French, English, and
Italian; and he was soon able to send help towards providing
education for the youngest of the household of twelve children in
the Camenz parsonage.&nbsp; In 1753 he gave himself eight weeks
of withdrawal from other work to write, in a garden-house at
Potsdam, his tragedy of &ldquo;Miss Sarah Sampson.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was produced with great success at Frankfort on the Oder, and
Lessing&rsquo;s ruling passion for dramatic literature became the
stronger for this first experience of what he might be able to
achieve.&nbsp; In literature, Frederick the Great cared only for
what was French.&nbsp; A National drama, therefore, could not
live in Berlin.&nbsp; In the autumn of 1755, Lessing suddenly
moved to Leipsic, where an actor whom he had befriended was
establishing a theatre.&nbsp; Here he was again abandoning
himself to the cause of a National drama, when a rich young
gentleman of Leipsic invited his companionship upon a tour in
Europe.&nbsp; Terms were settled, and they set out
together.&nbsp; They saw much of Holland, and were passing into
England, when King Frederick&rsquo;s attack on Saxony recalled
the young Leipsiger, and caused breach of what had been a
contract for a three years&rsquo; travelling companionship.&nbsp;
In May, 1758, Lessing, aged twenty-nine, returned to his old work
in Berlin.&nbsp; Again he translated, edited, criticised.&nbsp;
He wrote a tragedy, &ldquo;Philotas,&rdquo; and began a
&ldquo;Faust.&rdquo;&nbsp; He especially employed his critical
power in &ldquo;Letters upon the Latest Literature,&rdquo; known
as his <i>Literatur briefe</i>.&nbsp; Dissertations upon fable,
led also to Lessing&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fables,&rdquo; produced in
this period of his life.</p>
<p>In 1760 Lessing was tempted by scarcity of income to serve as
a Government secretary at Breslau.&nbsp; He held that office for
five years, and then again returned to his old work in
Berlin.&nbsp; During the five years in Breslau, Lessing had
completed his play of &ldquo;Minna von Barnhelm,&rdquo; and the
greatest of his critical works, &ldquo;Laocoon,&rdquo; a treatise
on the &ldquo;Boundary Lines of Painting and Poetry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
All that he might then have saved from his earnings went to the
buying of books and to the relief of the burdens in the Camenz
parsonage.&nbsp; At Berlin the office of Royal Librarian became
vacant.&nbsp; The claims of Lessing were urged, but Frederick
appointed an insignificant Frenchman.&nbsp; In 1767 Lessing was
called to aid an unsuccessful attempt to establish a National
Theatre in Hamburg.</p>
<p>Other troubles followed.&nbsp; Lessing gave his heart to a
widow, Eva K&ouml;nig, and was betrothed to her.&nbsp; But the
involvements of her worldly affairs, and of his, delayed the
marriage for six years.&nbsp; To secure fixed income he took a
poor office as Librarian at Wolfenb&uuml;ttel.&nbsp; In his first
year at Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, he wrote his play of &ldquo;Emilia
Galotti.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then came a long-desired journey to Italy;
but it came in inconvenient form, for it had to be made with
Prince Leopold, of Brunswick, hurriedly, for the sake of money,
at the time when Lessing was at last able to marry.</p>
<p>The wife, long waited for, and deeply loved, died at the birth
of her first child.&nbsp; This was in January, 1778, when
Lessing&rsquo;s age was 49.&nbsp; Very soon afterwards he was
attacked by a Pastor Goeze, in Hamburg, and other narrow
theologians, for having edited papers that contained an attack on
Christianity, which Lessing himself had said that he wished to
see answered before he died.&nbsp; The uncharitable bitterness of
these attacks, felt by a mind that had been touched to the quick
by the deepest of sorrows, helped to the shaping of
Lessing&rsquo;s calm, beautiful lesson of charity, this noblest
of his plays&mdash;&ldquo;Nathan the Wise.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Lessing&rsquo;s health was shattered, and he survived his wife
only three years.&nbsp; He died in 1781, leaving imperishable
influence for good upon the minds of men, but so poor in what the
world calls wealth, that his funeral had to be paid for by a Duke
of Brunswick.</p>
<p>William Taylor, the translator of Lessing&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Nathan the Wise;&rdquo; was born in 1765, the son of a
rich merchant at Norwich, from whose business he was drawn away
by his strong bent towards literature.&nbsp; His father yielded
to his wishes, after long visits to France and to Germany, in
days astir with the new movements of thought, that preceded and
followed the French Revolution.&nbsp; He formed a close
friendship with Southey, edited for a little time a
&ldquo;Norwich Iris,&rdquo; and in his later years became known
especially for his Historic Survey of German Poetry, which
included his translations, and among them this of &ldquo;Nathan
the Wise.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was published in 1830, Taylor died in
1836.&nbsp; Thomas Carlyle, in reviewing William Taylor&rsquo;s
Survey of German Poetry, said of the author&rsquo;s own
translations in it &ldquo;compared with the average of British
translations, they may be pronounced of almost ideal excellence;
compared with the best translations extant, for example, the
German Shakespeare, Homer, Calderon, they may still be called
better than indifferent.&nbsp; One great merit Mr. Taylor has:
rigorous adherence to his original; he endeavours at least to
copy with all possible fidelity the term of praise, the tone, the
very metre, whatever stands written for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">True!&mdash;But thy Recha too was on the

Upon the point of perishing&mdash;perchance<br />

If I have brought a prettier for Recha.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">And what of that&mdash;I tell you that my
conscience<br />
Will no be longer hushed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have bracelets,<br />

I chose them at Damascus.</p>

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s your

<p class="poetry">Take you as freely as I give&mdash;and

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">And cease?&mdash;Who questions, Nathan, but
that you are<br />
Honour and generosity in person;&mdash;<br />
Yet&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I&rsquo;m but a
Jew.&mdash;That was your meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">You better know what was my meaning,
Nathan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Well, well, no more of this,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be silent;<br />
But what of sinful in the eye of heaven<br />
Springs out of it&mdash;not I, not I could help;<br />
It falls upon thy head.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let it, Daya.<br />
Where is she then?&nbsp; What stays her?&nbsp; Surely, surely,<br

You&rsquo;re not amusing me&mdash;And does she know<br />
That I&rsquo;m arrived?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you yourself must speak
to,<br />
Terror still vibrates in her every nerve.<br />
Her fancy mingles fire with all she thinks of.<br />
Asleep, her soul seems busy; but awake,<br />
Absent: now less than brute, now more than angel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Poor thing!&nbsp; What are we
mortals&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she lay<br />
This morning sleeping, all at once she started<br />
And cried: &ldquo;list, list! there come my father&rsquo;s
camels!&rdquo;<br />
And then she drooped again upon her pillow<br />
And I withdrew&mdash;when, lo! you really came.<br />
Her thoughts have only been with you&mdash;and him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And <i>him</i>?&nbsp; What him?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him, who from the
fire<br />
Preserved her life,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was it?&nbsp; Where is
he,<br />
That saved my Recha for me?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young templar,<br />
Brought hither captive a few days ago,<br />
And pardoned by the Sultan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, a <i>templar</i><br />
Dismissed with life by Saladin.&nbsp; In truth,<br />
Not a less miracle was to preserve her,<br />
God!&mdash;God!&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without this man, who risked
afresh<br />
The Sultan&rsquo;s unexpected boon, we&rsquo;d lost her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Where is he, Daya, where&rsquo;s this noble
youth?<br />
Do, lead me to his feet.&nbsp; Sure, sure you gave him<br />
What treasures I had left you&mdash;gave him all,<br />
Promised him more&mdash;much more?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could we?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">He came, he went, we know not whence, or
whither.<br />
Quite unacquainted with the house, unguided<br />
But by his ear, he prest through smoke and flame,<br />
His mantle spread before him, to the room<br />
Whence pierced the shrieks for help; and we began<br />
To think him lost&mdash;and her; when, all at once,<br />
Bursting from flame and smoke, he stood before us,<br />
She in his arm upheld.&nbsp; Cold and unmoved<br />
By our loud warmth of thanks, he left his booty,<br />
Struggled into the crowd, and disappeared.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">But not for ever, Daya, I would hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">For some days after, underneath you palms,<br
/>
That shade his grave who rose again from death,<br />
We saw him wandering up and down.&nbsp; I went,<br />
With transport went to thank him.&nbsp; I conjured,<br />
Intreated him to visit once again<br />
The dear sweet girl he saved, who longed to shed<br />
At her preserver&rsquo;s feet the grateful tear&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Well?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in vain.&nbsp; Deaf to
our warmest prayers,<br />
On me he flung such bitter mockery&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">That hence rebuffed&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no, oh, no, indeed
not,<br />
Daily I forced myself upon him, daily<br />
Afresh encountered his dry taunting speeches.<br />
Much I have borne, and would have borne much more:<br />
But he of late forbears his lonely walk<br />
Under the scattered palms, which stand about<br />
Our holy sepulchre: nor have I learnt<br />
Where he now is.&nbsp; You seem
astonished&mdash;thoughtful&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">I was imagining what strange impressions<br />
This conduct makes on such a mind as Recha&rsquo;s.<br />
Disdained by one whom she must feel compelled<br />
To venerate and to esteem so highly.<br />
At once attracted and repelled&mdash;the combat<br />
Between her head and heart must yet endure,<br />
Regret, Resentment, in unusual struggle.<br />
Neither, perhaps, obtains the upper hand,<br />
And busy fancy, meddling in the fray,<br />
Weaves wild enthusiasms to her dazzled spirit,<br />
Now clothing Passion in the garb of Reason,<br />
And Reason now in Passion&rsquo;s&mdash;do I err?<br />
This last is Recha&rsquo;s fate&mdash;Romantic notions&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Aye; but such pious, lovely, sweet,
illusions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Illusions though.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes: and the one, her
bosom<br />
Clings to most fondly, is, that the brave templar<br />
Was but a transient inmate of the earth,<br />
A guardian angel, such as from her childhood<br />
She loved to fancy kindly hovering round her,<br />
Who from his veiling cloud amid the fire<br />
Stepped forth in her preserver&rsquo;s form.&nbsp; You
smile&mdash;<br />
Who knows?&nbsp; At least beware of banishing<br />
So pleasing an illusion&mdash;if deceitful<br />
Christian, Jew, Mussulman, agree to own it,<br />
And &rsquo;tis&mdash;at least to her&mdash;a dear illusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Also to me.&nbsp; Go, my good Daya, go,<br />
See what she&rsquo;s after.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t I speak with
her?<br />
Then I&rsquo;ll find out our untamed guardian angel,<br />
Bring him to sojourn here awhile among us&mdash;<br />
We&rsquo;ll pinion his wild wing, when once he&rsquo;s taken.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">You undertake too much.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when, my Daya,<br />
This sweet illusion yields to sweeter truth,<br />
(For to a man a man is ever dearer<br />
Than any angel) you must not be angry<br />
To see our loved enthusiast exercised.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">You are so good&mdash;and yet so sly.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll seek her,<br />
But listen,&mdash;yes! she&rsquo;s coming of herself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Nathan</span>,
<span class="smcap">Daya</span>, <i>and</i> <span

<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And you are here, your very self, my father,<br
/>
I thought you&rsquo;d only sent your voice before you.<br />
Where are you then?&nbsp; What mountains, deserts, torrents,<br
/>
Divide us now?&nbsp; You see me, face to face,<br />
And do not hasten to embrace your Recha.<br />
Poor Recha! she was almost burnt alive,<br />
But only&mdash;only&mdash;almost.&nbsp; Do not shudder!<br />
O &rsquo;tis a horrid end to die in fire!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN</span> (<i>embracing her</i>).</p>
<p class="poetry">My child, my darling child!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had to cross<br />
The Jordan, Tigris, and Euphrates, and<br />
Who knows what rivers else.&nbsp; I used to tremble<br />
And quake for you, till the fire came so nigh me;<br />
Since then, methinks &rsquo;twere comfort, balm, refreshment,<br
/>
To die by water.&nbsp; But you are not drowned&mdash;<br />
I am not burnt alive.&mdash;We will rejoice&mdash;<br />
We will praise God&mdash;the kind good God, who bore thee,<br />
Upon the buoyant wings of <i>unseen</i> angels,<br />
Across the treacherous stream&mdash;the God who bade<br />
My angel <i>visibly</i> on his white wing<br />
Athwart the roaring flame&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN</span> (<i>aside</i>).</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White wing?&mdash;oh, aye<br
/>
The broad white fluttering mantle of the templar.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Yes, visibly he bore me through the fire,<br />
O&rsquo;ershadowed by his pinions.&mdash;Face to face<br />
I&rsquo;ve seen an angel, father, my own angel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Recha deserves it, and would see in him<br />
No fairer form than he beheld in her,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Whom are you flattering, father&mdash;tell me
now&mdash;<br />
The angel, or yourself?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet had a man,<br />
A man of those whom Nature daily fashions,<br />
Done you this service, he to you had seemed,<br />
Had been an angel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not such a one.<br />
Indeed it was a true and real angel.<br />
And have not you yourself instructed me<br />
How possible it is there may be angels;<br />
That God for those who love him can work miracles&mdash;<br />
And I do love him, father&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he thee;<br />
And both for thee, and all like thee, my child,<br />
Works daily wonders, from eternity<br />
Has wrought them for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I like to hear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Well, and although it sounds quite natural,<br
/>
An every day event, a simple story,<br />
That you was by a real templar saved,<br />
Is it the less a miracle?&nbsp; The greatest<br />
Of all is this, that true and real wonders<br />
Should happen so perpetually, so daily.<br />
Without this universal miracle<br />
A thinking man had scarcely called those such,<br />
Which only children, Recha, ought to name so,<br />
Who love to gape and stare at the unusual<br />
And hunt for novelty&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why will you then<br />
With such vain subtleties, confuse her brain<br />
Already overheated?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me manage.&mdash;<br />
And is it not enough then for my Recha<br />
To owe her preservation to a man,<br />
Whom no small miracle preserved himself.<br />
For whoe&rsquo;er heard before that Saladin<br />
Let go a templar; that a templar wished it,<br />
Hoped it, or for his ransom offered more<br />
Than taunts, his leathern sword-belt, or his dagger?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">That makes for me; these are so many reasons<br
/>
He was no real knight, but only seemed it.<br />
If in Jerusalem no captive templar,<br />
Appears alive, or freely wanders round,<br />
How could I find one, in the night, to save me?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Ingenious! dextrous!&nbsp; Daya, come in
aid.<br />
It was from you I learnt he was a prisoner;<br />
Doubtless you know still more about him, speak.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis but report indeed, but it is said<br
/>
That Saladin bestowed upon this youth<br />
His gracious pardon for the strong resemblance<br />
He bore a favourite brother&mdash;dead, I think<br />
These twenty years&mdash;his name, I know it not&mdash;<br />
He fell, I don&rsquo;t know where&mdash;and all the story<br />
Sounds so incredible, that very likely<br />
The whole is mere invention, talk, romance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And why incredible?&nbsp; Would you reject<br
/>
This story, tho&rsquo; indeed, it&rsquo;s often done,<br />
To fix on something more incredible,<br />
And give that faith?&nbsp; Why should not Saladin,<br />
Who loves so singularly all his kindred,<br />
Have loved in early youth with warmer fondness<br />
A brother now no more.&nbsp; Do we not see<br />
Faces alike, and is an old impression<br />
Therefore a lost one?&nbsp; Do resembling features<br />
Not call up like emotions.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s th&rsquo;
incredible?<br />
Surely, sage Daya, this can be to thee<br />
No miracle, or do <i>thy</i> wonders only<br />
Demand&mdash;I should have said <i>deserve</i> belief?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">You&rsquo;re on the bite.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you quite fair with
me?<br />
Yet even so, my Recha, thy escape<br />
Remains a wonder, only possible<br />
To Him, who of the proud pursuits of princes<br />
Makes sport&mdash;or if not sport&mdash;at least delights<br />
To head and manage them by slender threads.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">If I do err, it is not wilfully,<br />
My father.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you have been always
docile.<br />
See now, a forehead vaulted thus, or thus&mdash;<br />
A nose bow&rsquo;d one way rather than another&mdash;<br />
Eye-brows with straiter, or with sharper curve&mdash;<br />
A line, a mole, a wrinkle, a mere nothing<br />
I&rsquo; th&rsquo; countenance of an European savage&mdash;<br />
And thou&mdash;art saved, in Asia, from the fire.<br />
Ask ye for signs and wonders after that?<br />
What need of calling angels into play?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">But Nathan, where&rsquo;s the harm, if I may
speak,<br />
Of fancying one&rsquo;s self by an angel saved,<br />
Rather than by a man?&nbsp; Methinks it brings us<br />
Just so much the nearer the incomprehensive<br />
First cause of preservation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pride, rank pride!<br />
The iron pot would with a silver prong<br />
Be lifted from the furnace&mdash;to imagine<br />
Itself a silver vase.&nbsp; Paha!&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the
harm?<br />
Thou askest.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the good?&nbsp; I might
reply.<br />
For thy <i>it brings us nearer to the Godhead</i><br />
Is nonsense, Daya, if not blasphemy.<br />
But it does harm: yes, yes, it does indeed.<br />
Attend now.&nbsp; To the being, who preserved you,<br />
Be he an angel or a man, you both,<br />
And thou especially wouldst gladly show<br />
Substantial services in just requital.<br />
Now to an angel what great services<br />
Have ye the power to do?&nbsp; To sing his praise&mdash;<br />
Melt in transporting contemplation o&rsquo;er him&mdash;<br />
Fast on his holiday&mdash;and squander alms&mdash;<br />
What nothingness of use!&nbsp; To me at least<br />
It seems your neighbour gains much more than he<br />
By all this pious glow.&nbsp; Not by your fasting<br />
Is he made fat; not by your squandering, rich;<br />
Nor by your transports is his glory exalted;<br />
Nor by your faith his might.&nbsp; But to a man&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Why yes; a man indeed had furnished us<br />
With more occasions to be useful to him.<br />
God knows how readily we should have seized them.<br />
But then he would have nothing&mdash;wanted nothing&mdash;<br />
Was in himself wrapped up, and self-sufficient,<br />
As angels are.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when at last he
vanished&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Vanished?&nbsp; How vanished?&nbsp; Underneath
the palms<br />
Escaped your view, and has returned no more.<br />
Or have you really sought for him elsewhere?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">No, that indeed we&rsquo;ve not.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not, Daya, not?<br />
See it does harm, hard-hearted, cold enthusiasts,<br />
What if this angel on a bed of illness&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Illness?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">DAYA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill! sure he is not.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold shudder<br />
Creeps over me; O Daya, feel my forehead,<br />
It was so warm, &rsquo;tis now as chill as ice.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">He is a Frank, unused to this hot climate,<br

Is young, and to the labours of his calling,<br />
To fasting, watching, quite unused&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">RECHA.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill&mdash;ill!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Thy father only means &rsquo;twere
possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">And there he lies, without a friend, or
money<br />
To buy him friends&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! my father.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">He, who, for one he never knew, or

Plunged into fire.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Dead surely not&mdash;for God rewards the

Done here below, here too.&nbsp; Go; but remember<br />
How easier far devout enthusiasm is<br />
Than a good action; and how willingly<br />

Tho&rsquo; at the time unconscious of its end,<br />
Only to save the toil of useful deeds.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, not much;<br />
But thee, it might indeed enrich: for when,<br />
As often happens, money is at ebb,<br />
Thou couldst unlock thy sluices, make advances,<br />
And take in form of interest all thou wilt.</p>

Then write a finis to our book of friendship;<br />
For I have reckoned on thee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How so, Hafi?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">That thou wouldst help me to go thro&rsquo; my

Dost shake thy head?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s understand each
other.<br />
Here&rsquo;s a distinction to be made.&nbsp; To you,<br />
To dervis Hafi, all I have is open;<br />
But to the defterdar of Saladin,<br />
To that Al-Hafi&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">HAFI.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoken like thyself!<br />
Thou hast been ever no less kind than cautious.<br />
The two Al-Hafis thou distinguishest<br />
Shall soon be parted.&nbsp; See this coat of honour,<br />
Which Saladin bestowed&mdash;before &rsquo;tis worn<br />
To rags, and suited to a dervis&rsquo; back,&mdash;<br />
Will in Jerusalem hang upon the hook;<br />
While I along the Ganges scorching strand,<br />
Amid my teachers shall be wandering barefoot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What dost thou think seduced
me.<br />
The wish of having not to beg in future&mdash;<br />
The pride of acting the rich man to beggars&mdash;<br />
Would these have metamorphosed a rich beggar<br />
So suddenly into a poor rich man?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">No, I think not.</p>

Flattered by Saladin&rsquo;s good-hearted notion&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Which was?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">HAFI.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all a beggar&rsquo;s
wants are only<br />
Known to a beggar: such alone can tell<br />
How to relieve them usefully and wisely.<br />
&ldquo;Thy predecessor was too cold for me,<br />
(He said) and when he gave, he gave unkindly;<br />
Informed himself with too precautious strictness<br />
Concerning the receiver, not content<br />
To leant the want, unless he knew its cause,<br />
And measuring out by that his niggard bounty.<br />
Thou wilt not thus bestow.&nbsp; So harshly kind<br />
Shall Saladin not seem in thee.&nbsp; Thou art not<br />
Like the choked pipe, whence sullied and by spurts<br />
Flow the pure waters it absorbs in silence.<br />
Al-Hafi thinks and feels like me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So nicely<br />
The fowler whistled, that at last the quail<br />
Ran to his net.&nbsp; Cheated, and by a cheat&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Tush! dervis, gently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">HAFI.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What! and is&rsquo;t not
cheating,<br />
Thus to oppress mankind by hundred thousands,<br />
To squeeze, grind, plunder, butcher, and torment,<br />
And act philanthropy to individuals?&mdash;<br />
Not cheating&mdash;thus to ape from the Most High<br />
The bounty, which alike on mead and desert,<br />
Upon the just and the unrighteous, falls<br />
In sunshine or in showers, and not possess<br />
The never-empty hand of the Most High?&mdash;<br />

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">The patriarch, I presume&mdash;&rsquo;twas he
that sent me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">The patriarch?&nbsp; Knows he not my badge, the
cross<br />
Of red on the white mantle?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I say?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Well, brother, well!&nbsp; I am a templar,
taken<br />
Prisoner at Tebnin, whose exalted fortress,<br />
Just as the truce expired, we sought to climb,<br />
In order to push forward next to Sidon.<br />
I was the twentieth captive, but the only<br />
Pardoned by Saladin&mdash;with this, the patriarch<br />
Knows all, or more than his occasions ask.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And yet no more than he already knows,<br />
I think.&nbsp; But why alone of all the captives<br />
Thou hast been spared, he fain would learn&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I<br />
Myself tell that?&nbsp; Already, with bare neck,<br />
I kneeled upon my mantle, and awaited<br />
The blow&mdash;when Saladin with steadfast eye<br />
Fixed me, sprang nearer to me, made a sign&mdash;<br />
I was upraised, unbound, about to thank him&mdash;<br />
And saw his eye in tears.&nbsp; Both stand in silence.<br />
He goes.&nbsp; I stay.&nbsp; How all this hangs together,<br />
Thy patriarch may unriddle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He concludes,<br />
That God preserved you for some mighty deed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Some mighty deed?&nbsp; To save out of the
fire<br />
A Jewish girl&mdash;to usher curious pilgrims<br />
About Mount Sinai&mdash;to&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time may come&mdash;<br
/>
And this is no such trifle&mdash;but perhaps<br />
The patriarch meditates a weightier office.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Think you so, brother?&nbsp; Has he hinted
aught?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Why, yes; I was to sift you out a little,<br />
And hear if you were one to&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&mdash;to what?<br />
I&rsquo;m curious to observe how this man sifts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">The shortest way will be to tell you plainly<br
/>
What are the patriarch&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they are&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">To send a letter by your hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By me?<br />
I am no carrier.&nbsp; And were that an office<br />
More meritorious than to save from burning<br />
A Jewish maid?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it should seem; must
seem&mdash;<br />
For, says the patriarch, to all Christendom<br />
This letter is of import; and to bear it<br />
Safe to its destination, says the patriarch,<br />
God will reward with a peculiar crown<br />
In heaven; and of this crown, the patriarch says,<br />
No one is worthier than you&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than I?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">For none so able, and so fit to earn<br />
This crown, the patriarch says, as you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">The patriarch here is free, can look about
him,<br />
And knows, he says, how cities may be stormed,<br />
And how defended; knows, he says, the strengths<br />
And weaknesses of Saladin&rsquo;s new bulwark,<br />
And of the inner rampart last thrown up;<br />
And to the warriors of the Lord, he says,<br />
Could clearly point them out;&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can I know<br />
Exactly the contents of this same letter?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Why, that I don&rsquo;t pretend to vouch
exactly&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis to King Philip: and our patriarch&mdash;<br />
I often wonder how this holy man,<br />
Who lives so wholly to his God and heaven,<br />
Can stoop to be so well informed about<br />
Whatever passes here&mdash;&rsquo;Tis a hard task!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Well&mdash;and your patriarch&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows, with great
precision,<br />
And from sure hands, how, when, and with what force,<br />
And in which quarter, Saladin, in case<br />
The war breaks out afresh, will take the field.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">He knows that?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes; and would acquaint King
Philip,<br />
That he may better calculate, if really<br />
The danger be so great as to require<br />
Him to renew at all events the truce<br />
So bravely broken by your body.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So?<br />
This is a patriarch indeed!&nbsp; He wants<br />
No common messenger; he wants a spy.<br />
Go tell your patriarch, brother, I am not,<br />
As far as you can sift, the man to suit him.<br />
I still esteem myself a prisoner, and<br />
A templar&rsquo;s only calling is to fight,<br />
And not to ferret out intelligence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">That&rsquo;s much as I supposed, and, to speak
plainly,<br />
Not to be blamed.&nbsp; The best is yet behind.<br />
The patriarch has made out the very fortress,<br />
Its name, and strength, and site on Libanon,<br />
Wherein the mighty sums are now concealed,<br />
With which the prudent father of the sultan<br />
Provides the cost of war, and pays the army.<br />
He knows that Saladin, from time to time,<br />
Goes to this fortress, through by-ways and passe<br />
With few attendants.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How easy
&rsquo;twere<br />
To seize his person in these expeditions,<br />
And make an end of all!&nbsp; You shudder, sir&mdash;<br />
Two Maronites, who fear the Lord, have offer<br />
To share the danger of the enterprise,<br />
Under a proper leader.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the patriarch<br />
Had cast his eye on me for this brave office?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">He thinks King Philip might from Ptolemais<br
/>
Best second such a deed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On me? on me?<br />
Have you not heard then, just now heard, the favour<br />
Which I received from Saladin?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,
yes!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And yet?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch
thinks&mdash;that&rsquo;s mighty well&mdash;<br />
God, and the order&rsquo;s interest&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alter nothing,<br />
Command no villainies.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that indeed not;<br />
But what is villainy in human eyes<br />
May in the sight of God, the patriarch thinks,<br />
Not be&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I owe my life to Saladin,<br
/>
And might take his?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&mdash;fie!&nbsp; But
Saladin,<br />
The patriarch thinks, is yet the common foe<br />
Of Christendom, and cannot earn a right<br />
To be your friend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>

With nothing in my soul to answer to it?<br />
Or what does correspond shall I suppress<br />
To please a patriarch?&nbsp; So thou dost not cheat us,<br />

What of humane their Founder felt, and taught,<br />

They value not because it is humane,<br />
Lovely, and good for man; they only prize it<br />
Because &rsquo;twas Christ who taught it, Christ who did it.<br

&rsquo;Tis well for them He was so good a man:<br />
Well that they take His goodness all for granted,<br />
And in His virtues put their trust.&nbsp; His virtues&mdash;<br

&rsquo;Tis not His virtues, but His name alone<br />
They wish to thrust upon us&mdash;&rsquo;Tis His name<br />
Which they desire should overspread the world,<br />

They thwart my purpose.&nbsp; They alone prevent it.<br />
They will on no account evacuate Acca,<br />
Which was to be the dower of Richard&rsquo;s sister,<br />
And, lest their order suffer, use this cant&mdash;<br />
Bring into play the nonsense of the monk&mdash;<br />

A cloak, a horse, a sabre, and a God!&mdash;<br />

And yet, Al-Hafi, I could quarrel with thee<br />
For this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

Will come this long time.&nbsp; Why&mdash;God only knows.<br />
We hear of no stir.&nbsp; To reduce, to spare,<br />
I am quite willing for myself to stoop to,<br />
Were it myself, and only I, should suffer&mdash;<br />
But what can that avail?&nbsp; A cloak, a horse,<br />
A sword I ne&rsquo;er can want;&mdash;as to my God,<br />
He is not to be bought; He asks but little,<br />
Only my heart.&nbsp; I had relied, Al-Hafi,<br />
Upon a surplus in my chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">HAFI.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A

And tell me, would you not have had me impaled,<br />

In hoarding up a surplus?&nbsp; Deficits&mdash;<br />
Those one may venture on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, but
how next?<br />
Could you have found out no one where to borrow<br />
Unless of Sittah?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">SITTAH.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would I have borne<br />
To see the preference given to another?<br />
I still lay claim to it.&nbsp; I am not as yet<br />
Entirely bare.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">SALADIN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet
entirely&mdash;This<br />

Take where, and as, thou canst; be quick, Al-Hafi.<br />
Borrow on promise, contract, anyhow;<br />
But heed me&mdash;not of those I have enriched&mdash;<br />
To borrow there might seem to ask it back.<br />

Thy vaunted Jew!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Jew, and praised by me?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">To whom his God (I think I still retain<br />

To whom, of all the good things of this world,<br />

The greatest and the least.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

The greatest, wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How&mdash;and of a Jew<br />
Could I say that?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didst thou not&mdash;of thy
Nathan?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Hi ho! of him&mdash;of Nathan?&nbsp; At that
moment<br />
He did not come across me.&nbsp; But, in fact,<br />
He is at length come home; and, I suppose,<br />
Is not ill off.&nbsp; His people used to call him<br />
The wise&mdash;also the rich.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">SITTAH.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich he&rsquo;s named<br

Now more than ever.&nbsp; The whole town resounds<br />

That he brings back.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he the rich
again&mdash;<br />
He&rsquo;ll be, no fear of it, once more the wise.</p>

<p class="poetry">What thinkst thou, Hafi, of a call on him?</p>

<p class="poetry">On him&mdash;sure not to borrow&mdash;why, you
know him&mdash;<br />
He lend?&nbsp; Therein his very wisdom lies,<br />
That he lends no one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">SITTAH.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly thon gav&rsquo;st<br

A very different picture of this Nathan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">In case of need he&rsquo;ll lend you
merchandise,<br />
But money, money, never.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a Jew,<br />
There are but few such! he has understanding,<br />
Knows life, plays chess; but is in bad notorious<br />
Above his brethren, as he is in good.<br />
On him rely not.&nbsp; To the poor indeed<br />
He vies perhaps with Saladin in giving:<br />
Though he distributes less, he gives as freely,<br />
As silently, as nobly, to Jew, Christian,<br />
Mahometan, or Parsee&mdash;&rsquo;tis all one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">SITTAH.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">And such a man should be&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">SALADIN.</span></p>

it then<br />
I never heard of him?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">SITTAH.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should be unwilling<br />
To lend to Saladin, who wants for others,<br />
Not for himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">HAFI.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye, there peeps out the
Jew,<br />
The ordinary Jew.&nbsp; Believe me, prince,<br />
He&rsquo;s jealous, really envious of your giving.<br />
To earn God&rsquo;s favour seems his very business.<br />
He lends not that he may always have to give.<br />
The law commandeth mercy, not compliance:<br />
And thus for mercy&rsquo;s sake he&rsquo;s uncomplying.<br />
&rsquo;Tis true, I am not now on the best terms<br />
With Nathan, but I must entreat you, think not<br />
That therefore I would do injustice to him.<br />
He&rsquo;s good in everything, but not in that&mdash;<br />
Only in that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll knock at other doors.<br />
I just have recollected an old Moor,<br />
Who&rsquo;s rich and covetous&mdash;I go&mdash;I go.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Why in such hurry, Hafi?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I guess?<br />
I scarcely know of whom you have been talking,<br />
And hear to-day, for the first time, of Nathan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Is&rsquo;t possible the man were hid from
thee,<br />
Of whom &rsquo;tis said, he has found out the tombs<br />

That lifts their marble lids, and thence obtains<br />
The golden oil that feeds his shining pomp?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Were this man&rsquo;s wealth by miracle
created,<br />
&rsquo;Tis not at David&rsquo;s tomb, or Solomon&rsquo;s,<br />

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ships fill every
harbour;<br />
His caravans through every desert toil.<br />
This has Al-Hafi told me long ago:<br />
With transport adding then&mdash;how nobly Nathan<br />
Bestows what he esteems it not a meanness<br />
By prudent industry to have justly earned&mdash;<br />
How free from prejudice his lofty soul&mdash;<br />
His heart to every virtue how unlocked&mdash;<br />
With every lovely feeling how familiar.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">SALADIN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Yet Hafi spake just now so coldly of him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">SITTAH.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Not coldly; but with awkwardness, confusion,<br
/>
As if he thought it dangerous to praise him,<br />
And yet knew not to blame him undeserving,<br />
Or can it really be that e&rsquo;en the best<br />
Among a people cannot quite escape<br />
The tinges of the tribe; and that, in fact,<br />
Al-Hafi has in this to blush for Nathan?<br />
Be that as&rsquo;t may&mdash;be he the Jew or no&mdash;<br />
Is he but rich&mdash;that is enough for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">You would not, sister, take his wealth by
force.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">What do you mean by force&mdash;fire,
sword?&nbsp; Oh no!<br />
What force is necessary with the weak<br />

Into my harem: I have bought a songstress,<br />
You have not heard her, she came yesterday:<br />
Meanwhile I&rsquo;ll think somewhat about a project<br />
I have upon this Nathan.&nbsp; Follow, brother.</p>

But not the kernel surely.&nbsp; I have seen<br />
Some such, methinks.&nbsp; Forgive me, noble Frank.</p>

<p class="poetry">What?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me leave.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Jew,
what wouldst thou have?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">The liberty of speaking to you!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So&mdash;<br />
Can I prevent it?&nbsp; Quick then, what&rsquo;s your
business?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Patience&mdash;nor hasten quite so proudly
by<br />
A man, who has not merited contempt,<br />
And whom, for evermore, you&rsquo;ve made your debtor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">How so?&nbsp; Perhaps I
guess&mdash;No&mdash;Are you then&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">My name is Nathan, father to the maid<br />
Your generous courage snatched from circling flames,<br />
And hasten&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If with thanks, keep, keep
them all.<br />
Those little things I&rsquo;ve had to suffer much from:<br />
Too much already, far.&nbsp; And, after all,<br />
You owe me nothing.&nbsp; Was I ever told<br />
She was your daughter?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a templar&rsquo;s duty<br
/>
To rush to the assistance of the first<br />
Poor wight that needs him; and my life just then<br />
Was quite a burden.&nbsp; I was mighty glad<br />
To risk it for another; tho&rsquo; it were<br />
That of a Jewess.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noble, and yet shocking!<br
/>
The turn might be expected.&nbsp; Modest greatness<br />
Wears willingly the mask of what is shocking<br />
To scare off admiration: but, altho&rsquo;<br />
She may disdain the tribute, admiration,<br />
Is there no other tribute she can bear with?<br />
Knight, were you here not foreign, not a captive<br />
I would not ask so freely.&nbsp; Speak, command,<br />
In what can I be useful?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&mdash;in nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;m rich.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me the richer Jew
ne&rsquo;er seemed<br />
The bettor Jew.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that a reason why<br />
You should not use the better part of him,<br />
His wealth?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, well, I&rsquo;ll not
refuse it wholly,<br />
For my poor mantle&rsquo;s sake&mdash;when that is threadbare,<br
/>
And spite of darning will not hold together,<br />
I&rsquo;ll come and borrow cloth, or money of thee,<br />
To make me up a new one.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t look solemn;<br />
The danger is not pressing; &rsquo;tis not yet<br />
At the last gasp, but tight and strong and good,<br />
Save this poor corner, where an ugly spot<br />
You see is singed upon it.&nbsp; It got singed<br />
As I bore off your daughter from the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN</span> (<i>taking hold of the
mantle</i>).</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis singular that such an ugly spot<br

Bears better testimony to the man<br />
Than his own mouth.&nbsp; This brand&mdash;Oh I could kiss it!<br

Your pardon&mdash;that I meant not.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tear<br
/>
Fell on the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find up more
such tears&mdash;<br />
(This Jew methinks begins to work upon me).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Would you send once this mantle to my
daughter?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Why?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That her lips may cling to
this dear speck;<br />
For at her benefactor&rsquo;s feet to fall,<br />
I find, she hopes in vain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Jew, your name<br />
You said was Nathan&mdash;Nathan, you can join<br />
Your words together cunningly&mdash;right well&mdash;<br />
I am confused&mdash;in fact&mdash;I would have been&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Twist, writhe, disguise you, as you will, I
know you,<br />
You were too honest, knight, to be more civil;<br />
A girl all feeling, and a she-attendant<br />
All complaisance, a father at a distance&mdash;<br />
You valued her good name, and would not see her.<br />
You scorned to try her, lest you should be victor;<br />
For that I also thank you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I confess,<br />
You know how templars ought to think.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still
templars&mdash;<br />
And only <i>ought</i> to think&mdash;and all because<br />
The rules and vows enjoin it to the <i>order</i>&mdash;<br />
I know how good men think&mdash;know that all lands<br />
Produce good men.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not without
distinction.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Here more, there fewer sure?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That boots
not much,<br />
The great man everywhere has need of room.<br />
Too many set together only serve<br />
To crush each others&rsquo; branches.&nbsp; Middling good,<br />
As we are, spring up everywhere in plenty.<br />
Only let one not scar and bruise the other;<br />
Let not the gnarl be angry with the stump;<br />
Let not the upper branch alone pretend<br />
Not to have started from the common earth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Well said: and yet, I trust, you know the
nation,<br />
That first began to strike at fellow men,<br />
That first baptised itself the chosen people&mdash;<br />
How now if I were&mdash;not to hate this people,<br />
Yet for its pride could not forbear to scorn it,<br />
The pride which it to Mussulman and Christian<br />
Bequeathed, as were its God alone the true one,<br />
You start, that I, a Christian and a templar,<br />
Talk thus.&nbsp; Where, when, has e&rsquo;er the pious rage<br />
To own the better god&mdash;on the whole world<br />
To force this better, as the best of all&mdash;<br />
Shown itself more, and in a blacker form,<br />
Than here, than now?&nbsp; To him, whom, here and now,<br />
The film is not removing from his eye&mdash;<br />
But be he blind that wills!&nbsp; Forget my speeches<br />

We did not choose a nation for ourselves.<br />
Are we our nations?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a nation then?<br />
Were Jews and Christians such, e&rsquo;er they were men?<br />

It is enough to be a man?</p>

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sultan
sends&mdash;<br />
The sultan wants to see you&mdash;in a hurry.<br />
Jesus! the sultan&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saladin wants me?<br />
He will be curious to see what wares,<br />
Precious, or new, I brought with me from Persia.<br />
Say there is nothing hardly yet unpacked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">No, no: &rsquo;tis not to look at anything.<br

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight, take it not amiss;<br

But we were so alarmed for what the sultan<br />
Could have in view.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I

person?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Whose, Saladin&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Not yet.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve neither shunned,<br />
Nor sought to see him.&nbsp; And the general voice<br />
Speaks too well of him, for me not to wish,<br />
Rather to take its language upon trust,<br />
Than sift the truth out.&nbsp; Yet&mdash;if it be so&mdash;<br />
He, by the saving of your life, has now&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Yes: it is so.&nbsp; The life I live he
gave.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">And in it double treble life to me.<br />
This flings a bond about me, which shall tie me<br />
For ever to his service: and I scarcely<br />
Like to defer inquiring for his wishes.<br />
For everything I am ready; and am ready<br />
To own that &rsquo;tis on your account I am so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">As often as I&rsquo;ve thrown me in his way,<br

I have not found as yet the means to thank him.<br />
The impression that I made upon him came<br />
Quickly, and so has vanished.&nbsp; Now perhaps<br />
He recollects me not, who knows?&nbsp; Once more<br />
At least, he must recall me to his mind,<br />
Fully to fix my doom.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not enough<br />
That by his order I am yet in being,<br />
By his permission live, I have to learn<br />
According to whose will I must exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Therefore I shall the more avoid delay.<br />
Perchance some word may furnish me occasion<br />

I am in haste.&nbsp; When shall we see you with us?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

To plant the weeds, or flowers, of thy own land.<br />
He wills not of these pranking gaudy blossoms<br />
Upon this soil.&nbsp; And I too must acknowledge<br />

<p class="poetry">In days of yore, there dwelt in east a man<br

Who from a valued hand received a ring<br />
Of endless worth: the stone of it an opal,<br />
That shot an ever-changing tint: moreover,<br />
It had the hidden virtue him to render<br />
Of God and man beloved, who in this view,<br />
And this persuasion, wore it.&nbsp; Was it strange<br />
The eastern man ne&rsquo;er drew it off his finger,<br />
And studiously provided to secure it<br />
For ever to his house.&nbsp; Thus&mdash;He bequeathed it;<br />
First, to the <i>most beloved</i> of his sons,<br />
Ordained that he again should leave the ring<br />
To the <i>most dear</i> among his children&mdash;and<br />
That without heeding birth, the <i>favourite</i> son,<br />
In virtue of the ring alone, should always<br />
Remain the lord o&rsquo; th&rsquo; house&mdash;You hear me,
Sultan?</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From son to son,<br />
At length this ring descended to a father,<br />
Who had three sons, alike obedient to him;<br />
Whom therefore he could not but love alike.<br />
At times seemed this, now that, at times the third,<br />
(Accordingly as each apart received<br />
The overflowings of his heart) most worthy<br />
To heir the ring, which with good-natured weakness<br />
He privately to each in turn had promised.<br />
This went on for a while.&nbsp; But death approached,<br />
And the good father grew embarrassed.&nbsp; So<br />
To disappoint two sons, who trust his promise,<br />
He could not bear.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to be done.&nbsp; He
sends<br />
In secret to a jeweller, of whom,<br />
Upon the model of the real ring,<br />
He might bespeak two others, and commanded<br />
To spare nor cost nor pains to make them like,<br />
Quite like the true one.&nbsp; This the artist managed.<br />
The rings were brought, and e&rsquo;en the father&rsquo;s eye<br
/>
Could not distinguish which had been the model.<br />
Quite overjoyed he summons all his sons,<br />
Takes leave of each apart, on each bestows<br />
His blessing and his ring, and dies&mdash;Thou hearest me?</p>

Appears, and claims to be the lord o&rsquo; th&rsquo; house.<br

As said, the sons complained.&nbsp; Each to the judge<br />
Swore from his father&rsquo;s hand immediately<br />
To have received the ring, as was the case;<br />
After he had long obtained the father&rsquo;s promise,<br />
One day to have the ring, as also was.<br />
The father, each asserted, could to him<br />
Not have been false, rather than so suspect<br />
Of such a father, willing as he might be<br />
With charity to judge his brethren, he<br />
Of treacherous forgery was bold t&rsquo; accuse them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">SALADIN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Well, and the judge, I&rsquo;m eager now to
hear<br />
What thou wilt make him say.&nbsp; Go on, go on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">The judge said, If ye summon not the father<br
/>
Before my seat, I cannot give a sentence.<br />
Am I to guess enigmas?&nbsp; Or expect ye<br />
That the true ring should here unseal its lips?<br />
But hold&mdash;you tell me that the real ring<br />
Enjoys the hidden power to make the wearer<br />
Of God and man beloved; let that decide.<br />
Which of you do two brothers love the best?<br />
You&rsquo;re silent.&nbsp; Do these love-exciting rings<br />
Act inward only, not without?&nbsp; Does each<br />
Love but himself?&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re all deceived deceivers,<br />
None of your rings is true.&nbsp; The real ring<br />
Perhaps is gone.&nbsp; To hide or to supply<br />
Its loss, your father ordered three for one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">SALADIN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">O charming, charming!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And (the judge continued)<br
/>
If you will take advice in lieu of sentence,<br />
This is my counsel to you, to take up<br />
The matter where it stands.&nbsp; If each of you<br />
Has had a ring presented by his father,<br />
Let each believe his own the real ring.<br />
&rsquo;Tis possible the father chose no longer<br />
To tolerate the one ring&rsquo;s tyranny;<br />
And certainly, as he much loved you all,<br />
And loved you all alike, it could not please him<br />
By favouring one to be of two the oppressor.<br />
Let each feel honoured by this free affection.<br />
Unwarped of prejudice; let each endeavour<br />
To vie with both his brothers in displaying<br />
The virtue of his ring; assist its might<br />
With gentleness, benevolence, forbearance,<br />
With inward resignation to the godhead,<br />
And if the virtues of the ring continue<br />
To show themselves among your children&rsquo;s children,<br />
After a thousand thousand years, appear<br />
Before this judgment-seat&mdash;a greater one<br />
Than I shall sit upon it, and decide.<br />

<p class="poetry">Hast thou not heard then how thy clemency<br />

Of his new-spared existence, from the flames<br />
Rescued my daughter.</p>

He looked like one that would&mdash;my brother too,<br />
Whom he&rsquo;s so like, bad done it.&nbsp; Is he here still?<br

Bring him to me&mdash;I have so often talked<br />
To Sittah of this brother, whom she knew not,<br />
That I must let her see his counterfeit.<br />
Go fetch him.&nbsp; How a single worthy action,<br />
Though but of whim or passion born, gives rise<br />
To other blessings!&nbsp; Fetch him.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Here let the weary victim pant
awhile.&mdash;<br />
Yet would I not have time to ascertain<br />
What passes in me; would not snuff beforehand<br />
The coming storm.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis sure I fled in vain;<br />
But more than fly I could not do, whatever<br />
Comes of it.&nbsp; Ah! to ward it off&mdash;the blow<br />
Was given so suddenly.&nbsp; Long, much, I strove<br />
To keep aloof; but vainly.&nbsp; Once to see her&mdash;<br />
Her, whom I surely did not court the sight of,<br />
To see her, and to form the resolution,<br />
Never to lose sight of her here again,<br />
Was one&mdash;The resolution?&mdash;Not &rsquo;tis will,<br />
Fixt purpose, made (for I was passive in it)<br />
Sealed, doomed.&nbsp; To see her, and to feel myself<br />
Bound to her, wove into her very being,<br />
Was one&mdash;remains one.&nbsp; Separate from her<br />
To live is quite unthinkable&mdash;is death.<br />
And wheresoever after death we be,<br />
There too the thought were death.&nbsp; And is this love?<br />
Yet so in troth the templar loves&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;<br />
The Christian loves the Jewess.&nbsp; What of that?<br />
Here in this holy land, and therefore holy<br />
And dear to me, I have already doffed<br />
Some prejudices.&mdash;Well&mdash;what says my vow?<br />
As templar I am dead, was dead to that<br />
From the same hour which made me prisoner<br />
To Saladin.&nbsp; But is the head he gave me<br />
My old one?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It knows no word of what<br />
Was prated into yon, of what had bound it.<br />
It is a better; for its patrial sky<br />
Fitter than yon.&nbsp; I feel&mdash;I&rsquo;m conscious of it,<br
/>
With this I now begin to think, as here<br />
My father must have thought; if tales of him<br />
Have not been told untruly.&nbsp; Tales&mdash;why tales?<br />
They&rsquo;re credible&mdash;more credible than ever&mdash;<br />
Now that I&rsquo;m on the brink of stumbling, where<br />
He fell.&nbsp; He fell?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather fall with men,<br
/>
Than stand with children.&nbsp; His example pledges<br />
His approbation, and whose approbation<br />
Have I else need of?&nbsp; Nathan&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Surely of his<br
/>
Encouragement, applause, I&rsquo;ve little need<br />
To doubt&mdash;O what a Jew is he! yet easy<br />
To pass for the mere Jew.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
coming&mdash;swiftly&mdash;<br />
And looks delighted&mdash;who leaves Saladin<br />
With other looks?&nbsp; Hoa, Nathan!</p>

You&rsquo;ll not have trusted me, and then my secret<br />

But, knight, how can you men so fondly fancy<br />
You ever hide such secrets from us women.</p>

That all at once you started up abruptly<br />
And in the twinkling of an eye were fled?<br />
That you left us without one civil speech!<br />
That you return no more with Nathan to us&mdash;<br />
Has Recha then made such a slight impression,<br />
Or made so deep a one?&nbsp; I penetrate you.<br />
Think you that on a limed twig the poor bird<br />
Can flutter cheerfully, or hop at ease<br />
With its wing pinioned?&nbsp; Come, come, in one word<br />
Acknowledge to me plainly that you love her,<br />
Love her to madness, and I&rsquo;ll tell you what.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,<br />
I thought I never in my life was likely<br />
To see you any more.&nbsp; For so I hoped<br />
In God.&nbsp; I did not vastly relish the proposal<br />
That I was bound to make you.&nbsp; Yes, God knows,<br />
How little I desired to find a hearing,<br />
Knows I was inly glad when you refused<br />
Without a moment&rsquo;s thought, what of a knight<br />
Would be unworthy.&nbsp; Are your second thoughts&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">So, you already know my purpose, I<br />
Scarce know myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you by this reflected<br
/>
That our good patriarch is not so much out,<br />
That gold and fame in plenty may be got<br />
By his commission, that a foe&rsquo;s a foe<br />
Were he our guardian angel seven times over.<br />
Have you weighed this &rsquo;gainst flesh and blood, and come<br
/>
To strike the bargain he proposed.&nbsp; Ah, God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">My dear good man, set your poor heart at
ease.<br />
Not therefore am I come, not therefore wish<br />
To see the patriarch in person.&nbsp; Still<br />
On the first point I think as I then thought,<br />
Nor would I for aught in the world exchange<br />
That good opinion, which I once obtained<br />
From such a worthy upright man as thou art,<br />
I come to ask your patriarch&rsquo;s advice&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">FRIAR</span>

<p style="text-align: center"><span

Ask not the knights&rsquo; advice, be their affair<br />
Ever so knightly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore one allows them<br
/>
To overshoot themselves, a privilege<br />
Which such as I don&rsquo;t vastly envy them.<br />
Indeed if I were acting for myself,<br />
Had not t&rsquo; account with others, I should care<br />
But little for his counsel.&nbsp; But some things<br />
I&rsquo;d rather do amiss by others&rsquo; guidance<br />
Than by my own aright.&nbsp; And then by this time<br />
I see religion too is party, and<br />
He, who believes himself the most impartial,<br />
Does but uphold the standard of his own,<br />
Howe&rsquo;er unconsciously.&nbsp; And since &rsquo;tis so,<br />
So must be well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rather shall not answer,<br

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet<br />
Let me consider what it is precisely<br />
That I have need of, counsel or decision,<br />
Simple or learned counsel.&mdash;Thank you, brother,<br />
I thank you for your hint&mdash;A patriarch&mdash;why?<br />
Be thou my patriarch; for &rsquo;tis the plain Christian,<br />
Whom in the patriarch I have to consult,<br />
And not the patriarch in the Christian.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,<br />
I beg no further&mdash;you must quite mistake me;<br />
He that knows much hath learnt much care, and I<br />
Devoted me to only one.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis well,<br />

Wait here, stand still&mdash;he has perceived you, knight.</p>

With fond attention forms to every virtue,<br />

Who by her pious love requites his goodness.<br />
And now suppose it whispered&mdash;say to me&mdash;<br />
This girl is not the daughter of the Jew,<br />
He picked up, purchased, stole her in her childhood&mdash;<br />
That she was born of Christians and baptised,<br />
But that the Jew hath reared her as a Jewess,<br />
Allows her to remain a Jewess, and<br />
To think herself his daughter.&nbsp; Reverend father<br />
What then ought to be done?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I

First will you please explain if such a case<br />
Be fact, or only an hypothesis?<br />
That is to say, if you, of your own head,<br />
Invent the case, or if indeed it happened,<br />
And still continues happening?</p>

&rsquo;Twill not be worth our while to think it through<br />
But I should recommend the curious person<br />

Such pro and contras have been agitated.<br />

A hundred times a day for Thabor; for<br />
The patriarch will set me about all work,<br />
And some that I can&rsquo;t brook&mdash;as for example&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">Be speedy, I beseech you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it happens<br />
That some one whispered in his ear to-day,<br />
There lives hard by a Jew, who educates<br />
A Christian child as his own daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN</span> (<i>startled</i>).</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Hear me quite out.&nbsp; So he commissions
me,<br />
If possible to track him out this Jew:<br />
And stormed most bitterly at the misdeed;<br />
Which seems to him to be the very sin<br />
Against the Holy Ghost&mdash;That is, the sin<br />
Of all most unforgiven, most enormous;<br />
But luckily we cannot tell exactly<br />
What it consists in&mdash;All at once my conscience<br />
Was roused, and it occurred to me that I<br />
Perhaps had given occasion to this sin.<br />
Now do not you remember a knight&rsquo;s squire,<br />
Who eighteen years ago gave to your hands<br />
A female child a few weeks old?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How
that?<br />
In fact such was&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now look with heed at me,<br
/>
And recollect.&nbsp; I was the man on horseback<br />
Who brought the child.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was you?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he from
whom<br />
I brought it was methinks a lord of Filnek&mdash;<br />
Leonard of Filnek.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the
mother.<br />
Died a short time before; and he, the father,<br />
Had on a sudden to make off to Gazza,<br />
Where the poor helpless thing could not go with him;<br />
Therefore he sent it you&mdash;that was my message.<br />
Did not I find you out at Darun? there<br />
Consign it to you?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It were no
wonder<br />
My memory deceived me.&nbsp; I have had<br />
Many a worthy master, and this one<br />
I served not long.&nbsp; He fell at Askalon&mdash;<br />
But he was a kind lord.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O yes, indeed;<br />
For much have I to thank him, very much&mdash;<br />
He more than once preserved me from the sword.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">O brave&mdash;you therefore will with double
pleasure<br />
Have taken up this daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have
said it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Where is she then?&nbsp; She is not dead, I
hope&mdash;<br />
I would not have her dead, dear pretty creature.<br />
If no one else know anything about it<br />
All is yet safe.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye all!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">FRIAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, trust
me, Nathan,<br />
This is my way of thinking&mdash;if the good<br />
That I propose to do is somehow twined<br />
With mischief, then I let the good alone;<br />
For we know pretty well what mischief is,<br />
But not what&rsquo;s for the best.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas natural<br
/>
If you meant to bring up the Christian child<br />
Right well, that you should rear it as your own;<br />
And to have done this lovingly and truly,<br />
For such a recompense&mdash;were horrible.<br />
It might have been more prudent to have had it<br />
Brought up at second hand by some good Christian<br />
In her own faith.&nbsp; But your friend&rsquo;s orphan child<br
/>
You would not then have loved.&nbsp; Children need love,<br />
Were it the mute affection of a brute,<br />
More at that age than Christianity.<br />
There&rsquo;s always time enough for that&mdash;and if<br />
The maid have but grown up before your eyes<br />
With a sound frame and pious&mdash;she remains<br />
Still in her maker&rsquo;s eye the same.&nbsp; For is not<br />
Christianity all built on Judaism?<br />
Oh, it has often vexed me, cost me tears,<br />
That Christians will forget so often that<br />
Our Saviour was a Jew.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, my good brother,<br />
Shall be my advocate, when bigot hate<br />
And hard hypocrisy shall rise upon me&mdash;<br />
And for a deed&mdash;a deed&mdash;thou, thou shalt know
it&mdash;<br />
But take it with thee to the tomb.&nbsp; As yet<br />
Has vanity ne&rsquo;er tempted me to tell it<br />
To living soul&mdash;only to thee I tell it,<br />
To simple piety alone; for it<br />
Alone can feel what deeds the man who trusts<br />
In God can gain upon himself.</p>

<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twas at Darun you met me with the
child;<br />
But you will not have known that a few days<br />
Before, the Christians murdered every Jew in Gath,<br />
Woman and child; that among these, my wife<br />
With seven hopeful sons were found, who all<br />
Beneath my brother&rsquo;s roof which they had fled to,<br />
Were burnt alive.</p>

you came,<br />
Three nights had I in dust and ashes lain<br />
Before my God and wept&mdash;aye, and at times<br />
Arraigned my maker, raged, and cursed myself<br />
And the whole world, and to Christianity<br />
Swore unrelenting hate.</p>

Than to imagine&mdash;if thou will it once.<br />
I rose and called out&mdash;God, I will&mdash;I will,<br />
So thou but aid my purpose&mdash;And behold<br />
You was just then dismounted, and presented<br />
To me the child wrapt in your mantle.&nbsp; What<br />
You said, or I, occurs not to me now&mdash;<br />
Thus much I recollect&mdash;I took the child,<br />
I bore it to my couch, I kissed it, flung<br />
Myself upon my knees and sobbed&mdash;my God,<br />

The greater part at least I have to lodge<br />

<p class="poetry">Into this house I go not&mdash;sure at last<br
/>
He&rsquo;ll show himself&mdash;once, once they used to see me<br
/>
So instantly, so gladly&mdash;time will come<br />
When he&rsquo;ll send out most civilly to beg me<br />
Not to pace up and down before his door.<br />
Psha&mdash;and yet I&rsquo;m a little nettled too;<br />
And what has thus embittered me against him?<br />
He answered yes.&nbsp; He has refused me nothing<br />
As yet.&nbsp; And Saladin has undertaken<br />
To bring him round.&nbsp; And does the Christian nestle<br />
Deeper in me than the Jew lurks in him?<br />
Who, who can justly estimate himself?<br />
How comes it else that I should grudge him so<br />
The little booty that he took such pains<br />
To rob the Christians of?&nbsp; A theft, no less<br />
Than such a creature tho&rsquo;&mdash;but whose, whose
creature?<br />
Sure not the slave&rsquo;s who floated the mere block<br />
On to life&rsquo;s barren strand, and then ran off;<br />
But his the artist&rsquo;s, whose fine fancy moulded<br />
Upon the unowned block a godlike form,<br />
Whose chisel graved it there.&nbsp; Recha&rsquo;s true father,<br
/>
Spite of the Christian who begot her, is,<br />
Must ever be, the Jew.&nbsp; Alas, were I<br />
To fancy her a simple Christian wench,<br />
And without all that which the Jew has given,<br />
Which only such a Jew could have bestowed&mdash;<br />
Speak out my heart, what had she that would please thee?<br />
No, nothing!&nbsp; Little!&nbsp; For her very smile<br />
Shrinks to a pretty twisting of the muscles&mdash;<br />
Be that, which makes her smile, supposed unworthy<br />
Of all the charms in ambush on her lips?<br />
No, not her very smile&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen sweet smiles<br />
Spent on conceit, on foppery, on slander,<br />
On flatterers, on wicked wooers spent,<br />
And did they charm me then? then wake the wish<br />
To flutter out a life beneath their sunshine?<br />
Indeed not&mdash;Yet I&rsquo;m angry with the man<br />
Who alone gave this higher value to her.<br />
How this, and why?&nbsp; Do I deserve the taunt<br />
With which I was dismissed by Saladin?<br />
&rsquo;Tis bad enough that Saladin should think so;<br />
How little, how contemptible must I<br />
Then have appeared to him&mdash;all for a girl.<br />
Conrade, this will not do&mdash;back, back&mdash;And if<br />
Daya to boot had prated matter to me<br />
Not easy to be proved&mdash;At last he&rsquo;s coming,<br />
Engaged in earnest converse&mdash;and with whom?<br />
My friar in Nathan&rsquo;s house! then he knows all&mdash;<br />
Perhaps has to the patriarch been betrayed.<br />
O Conrade, what vile mischiefs thou hast brooded<br />
Out of thy cross-grained head, that thus one spark<br />
Of that same passion, love, can set so much<br />
O&rsquo; th&rsquo; brain in flame?&nbsp; Quick, then, determine,
wretch,<br />
What shalt thou say or do?&nbsp; Step back a moment<br />
And see if this good friar will please to quit him.</p>

He&rsquo;s at the patriarch&rsquo;s.</p>

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such, at least,<br />

<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by this

<p class="poetry">Who has accused me to his patriarch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Accused thee, no, that by his leave is
false.<br />
Nathan do hear me&mdash;I am not the man<br />
Who would deny a single of his actions;<br />
What I have done, I did.&nbsp; Nor am I one<br />
Who would defend all he has done as right&mdash;<br />
Why be ashamed of failing?&nbsp; Am I not<br />
Firmly resolved on better future conduct?<br />
And am I not aware how much the man<br />
That&rsquo;s willing can improve?&nbsp; O, hear me,
Nathan&mdash;<br />
I am the templar your lay-brother talked of&mdash;<br />
Who has accused&mdash;You know what made me angry,<br />
What set the blood in all my veins on fire,<br />
The mad-cap that I was&mdash;I had drawn nigh<br />
To fling myself with soul and body whole<br />
Into your arms&mdash;and you received me, Nathan&mdash;<br />
How cold, how lukewarm, for that&rsquo;s worse than
cold.&mdash;<br />
How with words weighed and measured, you took care<br />
To put me off; and with what questioning<br />
About my parentage, and God knows what,<br />
You seemed to answer me&mdash;I must not think on&rsquo;t<br />
If I would keep my temper&mdash;Hear me, Nathan&mdash;<br />
While in this ferment&mdash;Daya steps behind me,<br />
Bolts out a secret in my ear, which seemed<br />
At once to lend a clue to your behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">How so?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do hear me to the end.&nbsp;
I fancied<br />
That what you from the Christians had purloined<br />
You wasn&rsquo;t content to let a Christian have;<br />
And so the project struck me short and good,<br />
To hold the knife to your throat till&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short and
good;<br />
And good&mdash;but where&rsquo;s the good?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet hear me, Nathan,<br />
I own I did not right&mdash;you are unguilty,<br />
No doubt.&nbsp; The prating Daya does not know<br />
What she reported&mdash;has a grudge against you&mdash;<br />
Seeks to involve you in an ugly business&mdash;<br />
May be, may be, and I&rsquo;m a crazy looby,<br />
A credulous enthusiast&mdash;both ways mad&mdash;<br />
Doing ever much too much, or much too little&mdash;<br />
That too may be&mdash;forgive me, Nathan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If<br />
Such be the light in which you view&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short<br
/>
I to the patriarch went.&nbsp; I named you not.<br />
That, as I said, was false.&nbsp; I only stated<br />
In general terms, the case, to learn his notion,<br />
That too might have been let alone&mdash;assuredly.<br />
For knew I not the patriarch then to be<br />
A knave?&nbsp; And might I not have talked with you?<br />
And ought I to have exposed the poor girl&mdash;ha!<br />
To part with such a father?&nbsp; Now what happens?<br />
The patriarch&rsquo;s villainy consistent ever<br />
Restored me to myself&mdash;O, hear me out&mdash;<br />
Suppose he was to ferret out your name,<br />
What then?&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; He cannot seize the maid,<br />
Unless she still belong to none but you.<br />
&rsquo;Tis from your house alone that he could drag her<br />
Into a convent; therefore grant her me&mdash;<br />
Grant her to me, and let him come.&nbsp; By God&mdash;<br />
Sever my wife from me&mdash;he&rsquo;ll not be rash<br />
Enough to think about it.&nbsp; Give her to me,<br />
Be she or no thy daughter, Christian, Jewess,<br />
Or neither, &rsquo;tis all one, all one&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never<br
/>
In my whole life ask of thee which she is,<br />
Be&rsquo;t as it may.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may perhaps imagine<br />
That I&rsquo;ve an interest to conceal the truth.</p>

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I neither have to you<br />
Nor any one, whom it behooved to know it,<br />
Denied that she&rsquo;s a Christian, and no more<br />
Than my adopted daughter.&nbsp; Why, to her<br />
I have not yet betrayed it&mdash;I am bound<br />
To justify only to her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TEMPLAR.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that<br
/>
Shall be no need.&nbsp; Indulge, indulge her with<br />
Never beholding you with other eyes&mdash;<br />
Spare, spare her the discovery.&nbsp; As yet<br />
You have her to yourself, and may bestow her;<br />
Give her to me&mdash;oh, I beseech thee, Nathan,<br />
Give her to me, I, only I can save her<br />
A second time, and will.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NATHAN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, could have saved her.<br

At times I know not what to make of you&mdash;<br />
Take it not ill of me, good Nathan.&nbsp; Will she<br />
Not have to play the Christian among Christians;<br />
And when she has been long enough the actress<br />
Not turn so?&nbsp; Will the tares in time not stifle<br />
The pure wheat of your setting&mdash;and does that<br />

She&rsquo;ll not be badly placed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

With comfits and with toys and glittering jewels?<br />
And what needs any sister wish for else&mdash;<br />
Only a husband?&nbsp; And he comes in time.<br />

For if theirs really be the only road<br />
On which &rsquo;tis safe to travel&mdash;they cannot<br />
With comfort see their friends upon another<br />
Which leads to ruin, to eternal ruin:<br />
Else were it possible at the same instant<br />
To love and hate the same man.&nbsp; Nor is &rsquo;t this<br />
Which forces me to be aloud complainant.<br />
Her groans, her prayers, her warnings, and her threats,<br />
I willingly should have abided longer&mdash;<br />
Most willingly&mdash;they always called up thoughts<br />
Useful and good; and whom does it not flatter<br />
To be by whomsoever held so dear,<br />
So precious, that they cannot bear the thought<br />
Of parting with us at some time for ever?</p>

<p class="poetry">Yes, just this instant.&nbsp; Coming
hitherward<br />
We past a fallen temple of the Christians&mdash;<br />
She all at once stood still, seemed inly struggling,<br />
Turned her moist eyes to heaven, and then on me.<br />
Come, says she finally, let us to the right<br />
Thro&rsquo; this old fane&mdash;she leads the way, I follow.<br

My eyes with horror overran the dim<br />
And tottering ruin&mdash;all at once she stops<br />
By the sunk steps of a low Moorish altar.&mdash;<br />
O how I felt, when there, with streaming tears<br />
And wringing hands, prostrate before my feet<br />
She fell</p>

Who there had hearkened many a prayer, and wrought<br />
Many a wonder, she conjured, intreated,<br />
With looks of heartfelt sympathy and love,<br />
I would at length take pity of myself&mdash;<br />
At least forgive, if she must now unfold<br />
What claims her church had on me.</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
